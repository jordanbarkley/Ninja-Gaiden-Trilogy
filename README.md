# Change Controls
With the addition of the X and Y buttons to the SNES controller, many players find themselves changing their grip. When playing ports of NES games, muscle memory for the A and B buttons may fail depending on where the players rests their thumbs naturally. Nintendo addresses this issue in Super Mario Bros. All-Stars with the addition of “Type A” and “Type B” controls. This hack allows the player to toggle between “Type A” and “Type B” by pressing L or R respectively at any point in the game.
